# C2PA Conformance Testing Tool

A web application for validating C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) manifests in media files. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for drag-and-drop file testing with detailed conformance reports.

**Built with the official [@contentauth/c2pa-web](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-js) SDK** - ensuring complete file format support and validation compatibility.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easy file upload via drag-and-drop or file selection
- **Client-Side Processing**: Uses c2pa-rs compiled to WebAssembly for fast, private processing
- **Official C2PA Trust List**: Validates signatures against the official [C2PA Conformance Trust List](https://c2pa.org/conformance)
- **Comprehensive Reports**: View detailed C2PA manifest information including:
  - Active manifest details
  - Assertions and claims
  - Ingredient information
  - Validation status with trust verification
- **Multiple Output Formats**:
  - Human-readable formatted view
  - Raw JSON display
  - Downloadable JSON reports
  - Copy to clipboard functionality

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)

### Installing Prerequisites

#### Install Node.js
Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies, including the official `@contentauth/c2pa-web` package. The postinstall script automatically copies the WASM binary to the `public/` directory.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite's development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

1. **Build the web application**:
```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Preview the production build**:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Drag and drop a media file, or click to select a file
3. The tool will process the file and display:
   - Active C2PA manifest information
   - Assertions and claims
   - Ingredient details
   - Validation status
4. Use the buttons to:
   - Toggle between formatted and raw JSON views
   - Download the report as a JSON file
   - Copy the JSON to clipboard
   - Upload another file

## Supported File Types

The tool supports any file format that can contain C2PA manifests:
- Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Videos (MP4, MOV, etc.)
- Audio files
- PDF documents

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: User uploads a file via drag-and-drop or file picker
2. **WASM Processing**: The file is processed entirely in the browser using the official `@contentauth/c2pa-web` library
3. **Trust Validation**: Signatures are validated against the official C2PA trust lists:
   - **C2PA-TRUST-LIST.pem** - Approved signing certificates for conformant products
   - **C2PA-TSA-TRUST-LIST.pem** - Trusted Time Stamp Authorities
4. **Report Generation**: C2PA manifest data is extracted, validated, and formatted
5. **Display**: Results are shown in both human-readable and JSON formats with trust status

## Trust Verification & Conformance

This tool uses the **official C2PA Conformance Trust List** to validate digital signatures:

- ✅ Only signatures from [C2PA conformant products](https://c2pa.org/conformance) are marked as trusted
- ✅ Certificates are validated against official trust anchors maintained by C2PA
- ✅ Time stamps are verified against approved Time Stamp Authorities
- ✅ Trust lists are fetched directly from the [official C2PA repository](https://github.com/c2pa-org/conformance-public/tree/main/trust-list)

**Important**: As of January 2026, the Interim Trust List (ITL) has been frozen. This tool uses the current official trust list, ensuring compatibility with conformant implementations.

## Privacy & Security

- **Client-Side Only**: All file processing happens in your browser
- **No Server Upload**: Files never leave your machine
- **No Data Collection**: No tracking or analytics
- **Trust List Updates**: Trust lists are fetched directly from the official C2PA repository when processing files

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found errors
If you see module import errors, try reinstalling dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### WASM initialization errors
Clear your browser cache and reload the page. The WASM module is loaded from the `@contentauth/c2pa-web` package automatically.

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run check` - Run Svelte type checking

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- **Svelte** - Reactive UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **@contentauth/c2pa-web** - Official C2PA JavaScript/WASM SDK from Content Authenticity Initiative
